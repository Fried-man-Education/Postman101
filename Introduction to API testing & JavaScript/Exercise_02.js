// Swap two variables in JavaScript
/*
The values for variables firstName and lastName need to be switched. The firstName needs to have the value Jamie, while the variable lastName needs to have the value Doe.
Without altering the initial variable definition, switch the values between the two variables.
Hint: Use a temporary variable named temp to hold the value of one of the variables.
